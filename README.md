           Tested on Python 2, OpenCV 2

0. Install openCV, [Dlib](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/)
1. run `git clone https://github.com/baicaiby/realHead.git` in your terminal
2. (you can skip this step, it's useful only when the shape_predictor\_68\_face\_landmarks.dat is damaged)Download the predictor: [predictor](https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat)
3. Put the shape_predictor\_68\_face\_landmarks.dat you just downloaded into the realHead/ folder
4. Run test\_headpose.py, the orientation data is saved in the same folder
